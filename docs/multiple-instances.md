# Multiple Instances

Use a separate home directory for each instance. Place `--home` before the subcommand; without it, nanobot uses `~/.nanobot`.

## Quick Start

```bash
nanobot --home ~/.nanobot-work onboard
nanobot --home ~/.nanobot-work webui --port 8766 --gateway-port 18791
```

Configure this instance's models and channels in WebUI Settings or `~/.nanobot-work/config.json`. Onboarding saves its default workspace as `~/.nanobot-work/workspace`.

Use the same home for other commands:

```bash
nanobot --home ~/.nanobot-work status
nanobot --home ~/.nanobot-work agent
nanobot --home ~/.nanobot-work gateway --port 18791
```

Concurrent instances need distinct gateway health ports and WebUI/channel ports. `webui --port` sets the WebUI/WebSocket port; `--gateway-port` sets the health port. For `gateway`, `--port` sets the health port. You can also save these ports in each config. Chat channels should use separate bot credentials.

## Path Resolution

| Data | Location |
|------|----------|
| Config | `<home>/config.json`, or explicit `--config` |
| Workspace | `<home>/workspace` by default; saved `agents.defaults.workspace` takes precedence; `--workspace` overrides both |
| Sessions | `<config-directory>/sessions/<workspace-id>/` |
| Media, logs, runtime state | Under the config directory |
| Memory, skills, cron jobs | Under the workspace |
| CLI input history | `<home>/history/cli_history` |

An explicit `--config` also selects the runtime data directory. Keep each config in its own directory and use separate workspaces to isolate memory, skills, and sessions. Selecting a home does not relocate paths saved in an existing config.

For custom config/workspace locations:

```bash
nanobot onboard --config ~/bots/work/config.json --workspace ~/work-agent
nanobot webui --config ~/bots/work/config.json --port 8766 --gateway-port 18791
```

You can also copy an existing config into the new directory and change `agents.defaults.workspace`. Model presets can be reused; select a different `agents.defaults.modelPreset` when needed.

Interactive `agent` and `webui` commands with the same config and explicit workspace selectors share a gateway. Different selectors produce separate runtime state and processes; one-shot and `--classic` agent runs execute directly. Background gateways receive `--home` through their command-line arguments.

## Health Check

Each gateway serves `GET /health` on `gateway.host:gateway.port`, bound to `127.0.0.1` by default. It returns `200` when the WebSocket channel is disabled or running, and `503` when enabled but not running. The JSON fields are `status`, `process`, `ready`, and `websocket`; other paths return `404`.

This checks process liveness and WebSocket readiness, not other chat channels, MCP servers, or model connectivity. See [CLI Reference](./cli-reference.md#gateway) for gateway management commands.
